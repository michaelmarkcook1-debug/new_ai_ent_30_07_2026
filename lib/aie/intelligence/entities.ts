// Shared enterprise-AI entity dataset (Query tab + cross-tab consumers).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// The Query v2 page originally defined its `ENTITIES` array, role types and a
// hand-maintained `WINNING_BY_LAYER` list *inside* the page component
// (app/query-v2/QueryV2Client.tsx). That locked the data to one tab and let
// the "winning by layer" list drift out of sync with the entity roster
// (e.g. SoftBank appeared as an Investor winner but was never a tracked
// entity). Lifting the data here makes it a single source of truth that
// Understand / Assess / Monitor and any future tab can import, and lets the
// layer-winners be DERIVED from the entities so they can never disagree.
//
// DATA STATUS: directional, evidence-labelled seed intelligence. Scores are
// analyst estimates, not audited fact. Each entity carries an evidenceGrade
// (E1–E5) and a dataCaveats note. Newly added entities (June 2026) are sourced
// from public reporting cited in the accompanying change notes.

// honest score: its AI-platform position differs sharply from its first-party
// AI-model IP, its AI-infrastructure capacity, and its AI-capital influence.
// `roleScores` lets one canonical entity express a distinct, defensible score

// IMPORTANT (scope): every number here is an AI-market-only analyst estimate,
// e.g. Microsoft's "Model Provider" score reflects first-party Phi/MAI IP, NOT
// GPT (which is OpenAI's model accessed via Azure = hosted + investment).
